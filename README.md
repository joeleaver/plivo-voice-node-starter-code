# plivo-voice-node-starter-code
An example starter project for voice calling on Plivo that includes a dynamic inbound IVR, call logging, and outbound voice surveys.

# To use:

Clone the repository, then run `npm install`

Change three variables:

`customerServiceNumber` to a phone number of your choosing.

`exampleCustomerNumber` The database will pre-populate an example 'appointment' record with this customer phone number.

`baseURL` This should be the FQDN of the running server.

Don't forget to configure your Plivo application and numbers.

Enjoy!
